# What is sorting



## Easy diff

Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular order, often numerically or alphabetically. Some common sorting algorithms include:

- Selection sort - Finds the minimum element in the unsorted array and swaps it with the element in the first position, then repeats this process for the remaining unsorted portion of the array.

- Bubble sort - Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.

- Insertion sort - Builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position. 

## Medium diff

- Merge sort - Recursively divides the array in half until there are single elements, then merges the smaller sorted arrays into larger sorted arrays.

- Quicksort - Chooses a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays of elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the subarrays.

- Heapsort - Uses a binary heap data structure to sort the array. It converts the array into a max heap, repeatedly extracts the largest element and places it at the end.
